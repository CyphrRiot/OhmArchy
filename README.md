# OhmArchy

**A customized Arch Linux setup based on Omarchy, optimized for the CypherRiot workflow.**

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern development system based on Hyprland by running a single command.

OhmArchy is an even more opiniated personal fork of [Basecamp's Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) with extensive customizations focused on privacy, development productivity, and clean aesthetics.

~/.local/share/omarchy/install.sh
```

## 🎯 Key Customizations

### 🔧 **Core System Changes**

- **Terminal:** Kitty (replaces Alacritty)
- **Browser:** Brave (replaces Chromium)
- **File Manager:** Thunar (replaces Nautilus)
- **Shell:** Fish as default (replaces Bash) with proper PATH configuration
- **Theme:** CypherRiot as default (replaces Tokyo Night)
- **Code Editor:** Added Zed alongside Neovim
- **Backup Tool:** Latest migrate binary for comprehensive system backup/restore
- **Memory Optimization:** Intelligent memory management that actually works
- **Blue Light Filter:** Automatic hyprsunset at 4000K for reduced eye strain

#### 🧠 **Memory Management Fix**

Linux's default memory management is **aggressively stupid** about caching. The kernel will happily consume 90%+ of your RAM for file caches, then struggle to free it when applications actually need memory. This causes:

- **Lag spikes** when opening new applications
- **Swap thrashing** even with plenty of "free" RAM
- **Poor responsiveness** during memory pressure
- **Misleading memory reports** (cached ≠ available)

**OhmArchy fixes this with intelligent sysctl tuning:**

```bash
vm.min_free_kbytes=1048576    # Always keep 1GB truly free
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50      # Be less aggressive about caching
vm.swappiness=10              # Prefer RAM over swap usage
vm.dirty_ratio=5              # Limit dirty page cache buildup
```

**Result:** Your system maintains responsive performance with proper memory pressure handling, ensuring applications get the RAM they need without the kernel being stubborn about giving up its precious caches.

## 🔄 System Management

### Updates

_Currently a work in progress... may not work as expected._

```bash
omarchy-update
```

Pulls the latest OhmArchy changes and updates system packages.

### Backup & Restore

```bash
migrate
```

**Note:** `migrate` is a TUI (Text User Interface) with **no command-line options**. Simply run the command and use the interactive menu to:

- Create comprehensive system backups
- Restore from previous backups
- Migrate configurations between installations
- Preserve all your customizations

The migrate tool automatically downloads the latest version during installation from [CypherRiot/Migrate](https://github.com/CyphrRiot/Migrate).
